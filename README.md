# calendar
This project was made as a lesson to check up on my knowledge of PHP and to learn more.

Seeing as I had problems uploading php files to the github, I ended up changing the files to .txt files 

## What is the meaning?
The website itself shows a calender that you can navigate around "Month - year" - It displays the name day and if a birthday is added it will display that on the calender.

## Am I satisfied?
The calender turned out pretty decent however the birthday is a bit bugged seeing as birthdays that have a 0 in the day wont work once the due date was.
Everything else went according to plan and if there was something that I would like to change it would be the generall layout and style of the website

## Want to use this project?
If you want to test this out what you need to do is start either have a server enviorment or use xampp so you can host apache.

Change the .txt files "except bdays.txt" to .php.
To input a birthday go to /bday.php and input the needed information
